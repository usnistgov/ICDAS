A new or existing python virtual environment must include the NIST_SG_SolarSim package.  To install the package use:

'pip install git+https://github.com/usnistgov/NIST_SG_SolarSim'

To test the environment, run the python script found in the virtual environment at
<virtual environment folder>\\Lib\site-packages\sg_solarsim\main.py

When newly cloned, this folder will not yet not contain a python IDE project.  

Because the NIST_SG_SolarSim package uses PySimpleGUI, not all IDEs work well with this package.  
PyCharm (community or professional editions) work well with PySimpleGUI.
